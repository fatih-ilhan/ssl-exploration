The file contains the following info:
1st row: name of the lesion
2nd row: class of lesion
3rd row: type of light used (one column is with White Light (WL) and the other with Narrow Band Imaging (NBI). This makes that, instead of only 76 columns we have 152)
4rt row until the last one: features 


A panel of seven doctors reviewed the videos and determined whether the lesions
appeared benign or malignant. We formed a consensus labelling using the individual expert labels.
Observations where six or more of the experts agreed were treated as labelled. Observations where
fewer than six experts agreed were treated as unlabelled.
The dataset also includes a ground truth set of labels, obtained using additional histological
measurements. The accuracy of the experts can be determined by comparing to the ground truth
labels.
